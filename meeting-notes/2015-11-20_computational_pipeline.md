# TERRAref Genomics Pipeline Meeting

* Date: Friday, Nov 20, 2015
* Time: 11:00-12:00 pm CST

## Participants:

* David Lebauer (TERRAref & TERRA cat 1, Illinois)
* Vicor Jongeneel (HPCBio, Illinois)
* Matt Hudson (Illinois)
* Chris Fields (HPCBio, Illinois)
* Noah Fahlgren (Danforth)
* Rob Alba (Danforth)

## Tenative:

* Elodie Gazave (Cornell)
* Pat Brown (TERRA cat 1, Illinois)

### Regrets:

* Mike Gore (Cornell)
* Todd Mockler (Danforth)

### Agenda

* Review proposal terraref/reference-data#19
* Determine roles / interests / contributions of each participating group


## TERRA REF

* 75 shared lines
* 40 de novo sequences, 
* 15 lines by PacBio. 
* 400 resequences  (enough coverage with enough coverage to do assembly 


Question: where to partition 15, 40, 400

Coordinated germplasm for G x E analysis

## TERRA MEPP

Sequencing? Yet to be determined. Pending discussions like this.

1. against existing reference genome
2. re-analyze data with the PacBio lines (with a separate pipeline)


## HPC Bio

* ED: should spread 15 PacBiom through diversity of germplam + more coverage on more likely to be commercial lines
* What can TERRA Ref do for the program? (and what are storage needs?)
* What can HPCbio provide?



  * TERRA MEPP
  * HPCBio
* Estimate data volumes (order of magnitude?) for each step
* Define Use cases

Need to figure out data flows for the entire project. 

* **Victor**: makes sense to analyze data at same place it is generated. Then deposit both raw data and derived products in common repository.
* **Chris Fields**: browsing and visualization
