Reference data committee

Present: Rob Kooper, David LeBauer, Jay Roloff, Yan Liu, Dan LaPine, Max Burnette, Scott Rhode

David went through is mockup workflow demo.  He will post it on github

Generally, the steps were
- How to know which extractor to use?  Need a Mask.  
- Create mask for suite of images
- Select a few images
- Button to launch vm, choose shell, Jupiter,â€¦
- Do LS of data directory
- Launch Jupiter

We can not see a real time build of the gantry system currently, but David showed us files on box that include pictures of plants at the field site and a diagram of data sources and flow at the site. 

For the Demo, we want to show default plant cv data or new data would be nice but not necessary.  Need to be able to reproduce PlantCV worklflow from tutorial and embed on Clowder

The group discussed renaming the project
