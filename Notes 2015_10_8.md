See Github for notes

### Additional issues
Data storage – David will present a number of options to DOE.  It’s still unclear if data needs to be accessible at all times and after the project or if it can be put into storage.  Look into Amazon Glacier.

Action Items:

**David LeBauer to develop CyberGIS statement of work**

**David LeBauer to look into feasibility of Amazon Glacier**

**David LeBauer to check compression, write to disk speed, and if this can be parallelized – talk to Donna Cox, Intel Expoint**
